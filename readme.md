# a simple Update script using ZIP

#### you might be asking, Why? why do i need a auto updating script?

##### simple. You can add any items to this github script and then it auto updates. No need from the user.

```
note 1: if you plan to use this on your repo, YOU MUST change the Wget ZIP FILE link.
note 2: Do not edit update.sh BESIDES the WGET link. only edit upgrade.sh
``` 

Zip instead of git
